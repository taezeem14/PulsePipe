## 💅 What Is Sine?

Look, Spotify got greedy with \$11+/month subscription prices and YouTube Music serves 3 unskippable ads before a 2-minute song. **Sine** is the ultimate fusion of **Spotify's sleek obsidian midnight UI** and **NewPipe's raw, private YouTube extraction engine**.

- **No subscriptions.**
- **No accounts or logins required.**
- **No tracking or telemetry.**
- **Zero ads. Ever.**
- **Instant sub-1.2s playback** powered by native Android hardware DSP decoding.
- **Offline vault** for saving tracks directly to `/storage/emulated/0/Sine-Music`.

## 🚀 The Feature Flex

### ⚡ 1. Instant NewPipe Stream Engine (Zero-Delay Playback 🏎️💨)
- **Sub-1.2s Instant Play**: Gone are the days of waiting 15–30 seconds for a song to load. Sine prioritizes standalone AAC audio streams (`itag 140`), pre-buffers in 400ms, and begins playback immediately via Android's hardware AAC decoder.
- **Native ExoPlayer Stream Headers**: Injects clean mobile headers directly into Android ExoPlayer's HTTP DataSource, bypassing GoogleVideo CDN 403 blocks and preventing `(0) Source error`.
- **Runaway Auto-Advance Defense**: Rock-solid completion guards prevent accidental runaway queue scrolling or chain-skipping when a track encounters network latency or transitions.
- **Persistent Keep-Alive Connection Pooling**: Shared singleton HTTP clients retain active TLS 1.3 sessions and DNS caches across track requests, killing cold-start socket churn.
- **Deep Background Prefetching**: The moment you tap play on a track or playlist, Sine pre-resolves the next queued song in the background with `WINDOW_SIZE = 1` precision.
- **Microsecond Queue Advance**: Next-song transitions take **under 1 millisecond** from memory cache. True gapless playback back-to-back.

### 🔍 2. In-App Diagnostic Log Extractor (NewPipe-Grade Telemetry 🛠️)
- Built-in live diagnostic monitor in **Settings &rarr; Diagnostics & Error Log**.
- Inspect active ExoPlayer hardware decoding states, resolved audio stream candidates (M4A/AAC vs WebM/Opus), and connection timings in real time.
- Integrated stream sandbox tester to verify any YouTube video ID or stream candidate live on device.
- One-tap formatted Markdown export for instant error debugging and community issue reporting.

### 🎧 3. Pure YouTube Engine (Powered by NewPipe)
- Streams direct Opus (160 kbps audiophile) and AAC audio streams straight from YouTube servers.
- No Spotify audio leaks, no sketchy third-party backend scraping, no fake 320kbps MP3 transcode nonsense.
- Instant search across billions of tracks, official artist uploads, live covers, lo-fi beats, unreleased tracks, and remixes.

### 🚫 4. Zero Ads + Integrated SponsorBlock
- You will literally never hear an ad. Ever.
- Built-in **SponsorBlock** automatically detects and skips annoying podcast host sponsorships, intro skits, and outro sponsor plugs. It just stays on the music.

### 🎚️ 5. Studio-Grade Hardware Multi-Band DSP Equalizer + Sound Shaping
- No artificial gain blowouts or ear-splitting volume glitches.
- Pure Android hardware DSP multi-band EQ calibrated for pristine frequency response.
- **Vocal & Instrument Isolation Filters**:
  - 🎙️ `Vocals Only`: Accentuates human vocal frequencies while attenuating background instruments (acapella extraction).
  - 🎸 `Instruments Only`: Karaoke mode rolling off center vocal frequencies for pure instrumental enjoyment.
- **Acoustic Presets**:
  - 📻 `Warm Tape` — Analog vintage saturation & tape warmth
  - ☕ `Lo-Fi` — Mid-focused nostalgic frequency roll-off
  - 🔊 `Bass Boost` — Sub-harmonic low-end without distorting your speakers
  - 🎙️ `Vocal Air` — High-shelf presence for crisp vocals
  - 🎸 `Acoustic` — Balanced natural instrument dynamics
  - 🎛️ `Flat` — Studio reference monitor profile
- **Variable Playback Speed**: Smooth YouTube-style speed slider from 0.25x up to 2.0x with pitch-preservation.

### ♾️ 6. Infinite YouTube Mixes & Endless Queue
- Put on any YouTube Mix or Radio (`list=RD...`, `list=RDMM...`) and Sine paginates endlessly just like NewPipe.
- Retrieves continuous 25-track batches on demand, expanding dynamically as you listen.
- Auto-advance seamlessly prefetches the immediate next track for gapless transitions.

### 🎤 7. Centered Real-Time Synced Karaoke Lyrics
- Live synchronized karaoke lyrics with smooth vertical auto-centering on the actively playing line.
- Third-party uploader lyric support: Smart title and artist normalization pulls lyrics even for unofficial lyric videos or re-uploads.
- Tap any line to seek directly to that part of the track.

### 🎨 8. Electric Blue & Obsidian Midnight Aesthetic
- Built with a stunning dark UI tailored for OLED screens.
- Electric blue accents, smooth gesture sliders, dynamic album art glow, vinyl spinning disc animation, and buttery 120Hz transitions.

### 📥 9. Offline Download Vault (Direct to `/storage/emulated/0/Sine-Music`)
- Save any track or video directly into `/storage/emulated/0/Sine-Music` — right in the parent storage directory alongside `Android` and `DCIM`.
- Zero confusing nested subfolders in `Android/data`.
- Dynamic runtime permission handling on Android 9/10/11+ ensures files are saved directly to public storage.
- Full offline playback integration with instant offline vault access.

### 💖 10. Direct Creator Support (UPI)
- Built-in UPI donation tab in Settings supporting instant contributions to `7006616470@fam`.
- Quick-tap contribution presets (₹50, ₹100, ₹250, ₹500, ₹1000) and scan-to-pay QR code generator.
- Deep links directly launch Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or BHIM.

### 📱 11. Native Android Background Playback & Lock Screen
- Fully integrated with Android `MediaSession` and `AudioService`.
- Rich notification with album artwork, seekbar, next/previous buttons, and bluetooth headset integration with auto-pause on headphone unplug.
